# adminsystem-base-on-thinkphp5
The first thinkphp project for the recruit to know how the thinkphp work and understand the struction of MVC
I am siren,we try to compile a dynamic adminsystem,someone told us that thinkphp is a good way for learning and achieve what we though,but the book 
that the website isn't easy for the white boy to learn ,I firstly take it up and try my first grogram,and I find it is not heavy just like zendframework,it's the frame we use to get all knowledge of fast-php we need ,for example,we can remove the address which including our infomation of file,we can use the router between the V and Cï¼ˆview and controller) to hide the spare of address,how interesting it is!
